# Capstone1-Marilao

## Overview
This is an ongoing front-end development project that Iâ€™m actively updating. Built with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, it serves as a showcase of my work, featuring projects such as free website creations, video advertisements, and a video portfolio designed using Canva. It also highlights the tools I use in my DevOps and development work, including Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, Bash scripting, and Infrastructure as Code, as well as full-stack technologies from my bootcamp training like JavaScript, ReactJS, Node.js, and MongoDB. The site features responsive layouts, branded visuals, and media integration to present content in a professional and engaging way.

## Features
- **Responsive Design**: Built with Bootstrap to ensure mobile-friendly layout.
- **Custom Styling**: Utilizes `capstone.css` for visual customization aligned with branding themes.
- **Media Integration**: Embedded video assets (`fbads.mp4`, `videoads.mp4`) and image logos to demonstrate design elements, marketing visuals, and brand identity.
- **Technology Showcase**: Displays logos of technologies used or relevant (Node.js, MongoDB, Heroku, Git, GitLab CI/CD, Postman, Sublime Text etc.), communicating development tools and workflow.
